"""
- traverse the maze in a DFT approach in order to create a path to all rooms in maze
- our DFT will need the following:
> storage = Stack()
> returned_path = [] ~> this is where we will place all possible paths based off of our neighbors in each traversal
> visited = set() ~> like usual but in this case we will need to determine if we hit a dead end
> push(0) aka our first room to our stack
